# LocalStabilityCompensation
 
This repository contains code, datafiles, and statistical analyses for **RNA Local Stability Compensation observed in a meta-database and quantified with massively parallel chemical mapping.**

**Repository Structure**
The repository contains three primary directories: bpRNAStructure, data_bpRNAStructure, and reactivity_libraries. The first contains the python module bpRNAStructure which is used to calculate the free energies of structure componenets, as well as the script bpRNA_ea which annotates these free energies in the structure type format used by bpRNA. The second directory contains tab-delimited files of the bpRNA-1m structures and their local energies, as well as the scripts involved with their generation and analysis. The third directory contains the script used to generate the designed structure libraries, the DMS reactivity results 'summary.json' and scripts involved with data analysis and figures.
